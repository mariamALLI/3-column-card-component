## My process
- Firstly created the HTML5 markup which included a div.container, within the container there were three(3) other divs created namely the id.card and class.card
- Secondly within the inner divs created in the container included the image src, followed by the hearder-text.class for h1, sub-text.class for p and the button which had an attribute of id and class value respectively.
- Thirdly the layout was desinged and styled using CSS and arranged according to the id and class provided in the markup

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Positioning

### What I learned

Some of my major learnings while working through this project includes the use of connectors. 

```css
In the media query section 
.proud-of-this-css {
  border-bottom-left-radius: 15px;
  border-top-right-radius: 0px;
}
```

### Continued development
Will continue my development and perfect my skill on CSS GRID
